            Using html, css, and javascript we build a basic functioning website. Its not the best or prettiest but its a good starting point for a beginner. Gets you thinking about the pieces that make up a website.

            Using multiple languages we will create simple programs that illustrate the core concepts of programming.
            <dl>
                <dt>if else statements</dt>
                <dd>These statements control program flow if something is true then do this else do this. Its also called branching.</dd>
              
                <dt>classes</dt>
                <dd>Classes are a way of grouping data together in a nice package that can be duplicated easily and resued. Similar to mechanical blueprints the blueprint can be physically built into a machine. With classes, objects can be made which act like a machine with levers and buttons that when pressed or pulled produce an action or event. We call the action or event a funtion. </dd>

                <dt>functions</dt>
                <dd>A function is like a button that does a particular thing when you push it. With a function it will execute a block of code when it is called.</dd>

                <dt>variables</dt>
                <dd>Variables are way to hold data in a tiny container to be reused, duplicated, or changed. Similar to using a garbage can, the garbage can is like a variable it can be emptied or filled.</dd>

                <dt>types</dt>
                <dd>Types are the type of data that a variable can hold. There are many types built into a language including a boolean, int, double and each type has different properties and function. A boolean for example can be true or false and an int can be a negative or positive number.</dd>

                <dt>polymorphism</dt>
                <dd>Polymorpism is a way to link parts together that normally can't be linked. The key to start a vehical is usually unique and can only start that particular vehical. But with polymorphism its like having a master key that can start any vehical as long as its a vehical. We obviously can't use it to start a dog or cat. In programming we make objects using classes. The classes are a blueprint for the object. Some classes are linked together where a class can inherit from another class. Like a child inherits his fathers traits , the father is the base class and the son is derived class. Using polymorphism the son can take his key and start the fathers car.</dd>

                <dt>switch statements</dt>
                <dd>Switch is like a pop machine. Say you choose pepsi, you push the button. The machine will switch the mechanism inside to the section where pepsi is stored and then dispense it. Switch statements will switch to a case statement that matches the variable chosen or the button that was pushed. The case statements hold the instructions for dispensing the chosen soda.</dd>

                <dt>loops</dt>
                <dd>Loops are a way to control repetitive code. In a loop you tell it how many times you want it to repeat and when to stop.</dd>

                <dt>operators</dt>
                <dd>Examples of operators are: +,=,-. The + operator performs addition in most programming languages. </dd>
