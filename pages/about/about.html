        <h2>Why I made this website?</h2>
        <p>I am currently studying computer programming and learning to program mainly in C++. I thought it would be beneficial to make tutorials along the way to help others learn to program. I also need to learn web development for the classes I'll be taking in school. So building a website from scratch that teaches how to build a website from scratch seemed like a good way to learn web development. Same with DirectX12 and the Windows API, I can learn alot by making a tutorial. I eventually plan to build a game engine once I get comfortable with DirectX12 thats the main goal of my studying to build a game engine from scratch. I have built a renderer that can render shapes (triangle, cone, square) and load them in from an obj file. Which was fun once I had a working program.</p>

        <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
        <p>Anyone and everyone that desires to learn programming. Its tailored for those who want to get up and running as fast as possible. To learn by doing. The tasks are where the learning happens so don't skip them they are the most important part. Ive tried to make the tutorials straightfoward and to the point so as not to waste anyones time.</p>

        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>My name is Chris Hopkins and I live in Canada. In the province of Saskatchewan and the city of Regina. I started programming as a hobby a couple of years ago. I became interested after watching a youtuber named cherno and his c++ video playlist. So I started learning C++ whenever I had spare time. I then decided to quit my job as a sheet metal worker and study full time attempting to write programs from scratch. I found it to be alot of fun but very challenging. I am currently planning to go to college next fall and enroll in a program called Computer Systems Technology.</p>
