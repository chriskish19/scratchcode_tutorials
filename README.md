# scratchcode_tutorials
A tutorial website, that I work on occassionally. It is currently live and runs through github 
[click here](https://chriskish19.github.io/scratchcode_tutorials/) to view it.

# Everything from scratch
Main goal of the tutorials is to use minimal libraries and implement everything from scratch where possible. 
I am no expert on webdev, I learn on the go and then try to teach what I learn. 

# FAQ
Q: When will the website be finished?
A: A couple years from now. Depends how often I work on it. Could be sooner.
